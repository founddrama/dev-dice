#### Ha ha, OK what is this?

This started as a joke a couple of years ago when a friend/co-worker was brought
onto a new project and we observed that its technology stack appeared to have
nothing to do with the technology stack currently in place. And while this was
not necessarily a Bad Thing&trade;, it also seemed... Strange. Thus was the idea
of Project Management Dev Dice born. It incubated for a while, simmering in our
brains until finally I decided to cook this up.

I wanted to play around with a couple of things, and this provided an excuse to
do so. As for which things:

- [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/)
- [Bower](http://twitter.github.io/bower/)
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
